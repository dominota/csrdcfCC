# CSRDCF
C++ test code for the tracker described in the CVPR16 paper "Discriminative Correlation Filter Tracker with Channel and Spatial Reliability" by Alan Luke탑i훾. CSRDCF C++ code is from opencv module(https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) which is contributed by Alan Luke탑i훾.

I wrote this code only for testing CSRDCF performance. Seems CSRDCF tracking accuracy is better than STAPLE, but STAPLE can run in high FPS and bundling box is more adaptable to object size change. FYI, It's only a rough estimate.
